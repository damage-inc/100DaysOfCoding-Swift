 “You use error handling to respond to error conditions your program may encounter during execution.
 
 In contrast to optionals, which can use the presence or absence of a value to communicate success or failure of a function, error handling allows you to determine the underlying cause of failure, and, if necessary, propagate the error to another part of your program.
 
 When a function encounters an error condition, it throws an error. That function’s caller can then catch the error and respond appropriately.
 
 A function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws keyword in its declaration. When you call a function that can throw an error, you prepend the try keyword to the expression.
 
 Swift automatically propagates errors out of their current scope until they’re handled by a catch clause.”
